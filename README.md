# metaweather_api_test_suite

## Background 

This test suite tests the MetaWeather API (https://www.metaweather.com/api/). The focus of the suite is testing specific dates
with a specific location (using Yahoo's woeid API). Invalid locations and dates have also been added. 

## Instructions 

Before running the test suite, please ensure that you have Node.js and Cypress installed. Instructions on 
how this is to be done can be found here: 

https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#System-requirements

Afterwards, depending on where the directory with the tests is located, run the following command(s): 

cd xxx/meta_weather_api/
node_modules/.bin/cypress open

This should open Cypress for you with the following screen:

In order to the tests, you either select 'Run all specs' or click on the specific test you wish to run. 

## Issues and Bugs 

As setting up Node.js and Cypress took up the longest (issues with sudo and folder permissions), I was not able to find a reliable way on how to test the data returned from the response. Several attempts were made, but more investigation / time would be required which the week during this was implemented did not allow for (vet visits and subsequent kitty babysitting). 

A bug that was encountered relatively late deals with Javascript's new Date() method. It returns the wrong date which can cause some intermittent failures. I tried to use 'Date.now()' as an argument but it returned the same result. Again, more time and familiarity with Javascript would be required to investigate this further.
