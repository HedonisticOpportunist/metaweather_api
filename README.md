# metaweather_api

## Background 

This test suite tests the MetaWeather API (https://www.metaweather.com/api/). The focus on the test is testing specific dates
with a specific location (using Yahoo's woeid API). 

## Instructions 

Before running the test suite, please ensure that you have Node.js and Cypress installed. Instructions on 
how this is to be done can be found here: 

https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#System-requirements

Afterwards, depending on where the directory with the tests is located, run the following command(s): 

cd xxx/meta_weather_api/
node_modules/.bin/cypress open

This should open Cypress for you with the following screen:
